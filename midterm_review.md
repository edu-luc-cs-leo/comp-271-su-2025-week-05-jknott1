# Midterm Review - James Knott

If I'm going to be honest, I'm not nor have I ever really been confident in my skills in computer programming. Seeing as this
(what I consider to be) only my third real computer science class, and second object oriented class at that, I wasn't sure how well
I was going to do. Although I definitely have made a couple mistakes, both in coding and professionally, I think that I am doing a 
lot better than I thought I was going to.

In terms of assignments, I think I've been pretty diligent and consistent with how I code. However, there were a few issues still, as I said. First, in the beginning, I kind of had a harder time getting into the swing of things and following proper convention. There were a couple violations of the programmers pact in my earlier work - multiple return statements and magic values. I've worked on (and for the most part fixed) my issue with multiple return statements, but sometimes I get somewhat confused when elimating magic values for other non-numeric primitives. This will be my focus for the second part of the course.

Last but not least, I definitely have had one professional issue: I've missed a couple (2) days of class. Both of these times, it was because I overslept. There is no complex solution to this; I need to just work on time management. Other than that I think that I definitely engage in class as much as I can, strive for timeliness, put in the work, and ask questions when I have them. One thing that I think that I con work on is engaging in supplementary material more - like extra problems from the book.

All in all, as I've said earlier, I think that I'm doing fairly well in the course (better than I thought), which has given me a little more confidence in my skills.
